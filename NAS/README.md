This repo is heavily based on the repo for the paper [FLAG: Adversarial Data Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09891).

We update the original implementation to icnclude Bayesian Optimization and a Generalized Min-Max-Sum Readout Function.

To run the DeeperGCN variants with the above augmentations, run the following command:

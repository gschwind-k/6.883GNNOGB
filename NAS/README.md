This repo is heavily based on the repo for the paper [FLAG: Adversarial Data Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09891).

We update the original implementation to icnclude Bayesian Optimization and a Generalized Min-Max-Sum Readout Function.

To run the DeeperGCN variants with the above augmentations, go to the subfolder **6.883GNNOGB/NAS/deep_gcns_torch/examples/ogb/ogbg_mol/** and run the following commands:
